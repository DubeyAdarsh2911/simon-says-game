🎮 Simon Says Game
Welcome to the Simon Says Game! The classic memory game that tests your ability to remember and repeat sequences of colored buttons. Each time you successfully repeat the sequence, the difficulty increases, challenging your memory and reaction time. Can you get the highest score? Let’s find out!

🚀 Features
Interactive Gameplay: Colored buttons flash in a specific order, and you must repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons.

Increasing Difficulty: As you advance, the sequence gets longer, pushing your memory and reflexes to the limit.

Game Over Screen: If you make a mistake, the game ends and displays your score.

Responsive Design: Play the game on any device with a responsive layout.

Instructions: Press any key to start the game, and follow the sequence of colors.

Simple and Engaging: Easy to pick up, but challenging to master.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – Used to create the structure and content of the game.

CSS3 – For styling and visual design, including animations for the flashing buttons.

JavaScript – Core logic of the game, including event handling, game flow, and sequence checking.

🚀 How to Play
Start the Game:

Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.

The game begins with a simple sequence of colors flashing in a random order.

Follow the Sequence:

Click on the flashing buttons in the same order as shown.

Each successful round adds a new button to the sequence.

Keep Going:

The sequence will continue to grow with each level.

Challenge yourself to remember longer sequences as the game progresses.

Game Over:

If you click the wrong button, the game ends.

Your final score (the highest level reached) is displayed, and you can press any key to restart the game.

🧠 Learning Highlights
Game Logic & Flow: Implementing the sequence and user input checking, handling the game state (running, game over, etc.).

CSS Animations: Using CSS to create smooth visual effects such as the flashing of the buttons when the sequence is played and when the user presses a button.

DOM Manipulation: Managing user input and dynamically updating the page content based on game progress.

Event Handling: Creating interactive buttons using event listeners to capture user clicks and key presses.

💡 Game Design Details
Color Sequence: The game generates a random sequence of colors that the user must follow. Each color corresponds to a button.

Button Flashing Animation: Each time a new sequence is generated, the buttons flash one by one to show the user the correct order.

Error Handling: If the user clicks a button in the wrong order, the game ends, showing the user a "Game Over" message with their score and prompting them to start again by pressing any key.

📌 Notes
Accessibility: The game relies on visual color cues. Consider adding sound or visual contrast for accessibility improvements in future versions.

Game Reset: The game resets when the user makes an error or presses any key after a game-over scenario.

Expansion Ideas:

Add sound effects when buttons flash and when the user clicks them.

Introduce difficulty levels, such as slower or faster sequences.

Add a high score tracker to store the best score across sessions.
